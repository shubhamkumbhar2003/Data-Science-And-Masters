Like to calculate mean , mode, median where as in Inferential Statistics , You randomly select a sample of 11th graders in your state and collect data on their SAT scores and other characteristics.

    "Level of measurement is important as it determines the type of statistical analysis you can carry out. As a result, it affects both the nature and the depth of insights you’re able to glean from your data.\n",
    "There are 4 types of level\n",
    "1)Nominal:-The nominal scale simply categorizes variables according to qualitative labels (or names). These labels and groupings don’t have any order or hierarchy to them, nor do they convey any numerical value. For example, the variable “hair color” could be measured on a nominal scale according to the following categories: blonde hair, brown hair, gray hair, and so on.\n",
    "2)Ordinal:-The ordinal scale also categorizes variables into labeled groups, and these categories have an order or hierarchy to them. For example, you could measure the variable “income” on an ordinal scale as follows: low income, medium income, high income. Another example could be level of education, classified as follows: high school, master’s degree, doctorate. These are still qualitative labels (as with the nominal scale), but you can see that they follow a hierarchical order.\n",
    "3)Interval:-The interval scale is a numerical scale which labels and orders variables, with a known, evenly spaced interval between each of the values. An oft-cited example of interval data is temperature in Fahrenheit, where the difference between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit is exactly the same as the difference between, say, 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "4)Ratio:-The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale, with one key difference: The ratio scale has what’s known as a “true zero.” A good example of ratio data is weight in kilograms. If something weighs zero kilograms, it truly weighs nothing—compared to temperature (interval data), where a value of zero degrees doesn’t mean there is “no temperature,”"

    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it determines the appropriate statistical methods and techniques that can be used to interpret and analyze the data accurately. Different levels of measurement have unique properties and constraints, and using the wrong analysis method can lead to misleading conclusions and erroneous interpretations.\n",
    "Suppose we want to analyze customer satisfaction with a product using survey data. The survey includes questions with Likert scale responses (ordinal data) to measure satisfaction levels ranging from 1 (Very Dissatisfied) to 5 (Very Satisfied). Additionally, there is a question about the number of months the customer has been using the product (ratio data).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we fail to recognize the level of measurement for each variable, we might erroneously perform inappropriate statistical analyses. For instance, calculating the mean satisfaction score (an inappropriate measure for ordinal data) might lead us to believe that the average satisfaction is 3.8, indicating moderate satisfaction. However, this is not valid since the mean doesn't work well with ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for the variable \"number of months using the product\" (ratio data), we can accurately calculate the mean, standard deviation, and other relevant statistics to gain insights into the average customer's longevity of product usage.\n",

    "Definition:-\n",
    "Nominal Data:- Nominal Data is the Lowest level of measurement. It Involves categorical Variables that can be divided into Distinct Categories or groups, but there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories. Each Category is considered equally important and does not imply any level of magnitude or direction. Examples include gender (male/female), eye color (blue/brown/green).\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data is the second level of measurement. It involves categorical variables that can be ranked or ordered, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily uniform. In other words, the order of categories matters, but the differences between them may not have a consistent meaning.\n",
    "1)Mathematical Operations:\n",
    "    Nominal Data:Since there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication are not meaningful. You can only count the frequency of each category and calculate percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ordinal Data: While ordinal data allows for ranking, the differences between the ranks are not uniformly meaningful, making mathematical operations beyond counting and ordering inappropriate. For instance, you can determine which rank is higher, but you can't conclude that the difference between the ranks represents a consistent increase in magnitude.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2)Summary Statistics:\n",
    "Nominal Data: For nominal data, we use categorical measures like mode to describe the central tendency, and we can calculate the frequency of each category. However, measures such as mean and median are not meaningful because there is no numeric representation of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Similar to nominal data, ordinal data can use mode and frequency to describe the central tendency. In addition, median can be used since it represents the middle value when the data is ranked. However, mean is generally avoided because it does not capture the underlying ordinal nature of the data."

    "Descriptive Statistics are used to Summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They Provide a simple and concise way to understand the data basic's characteristics. These statistics do not involve making inferences or drawing conclusions beyond the data being analyzed.\n",
    " Let's say we have a dataset consisting of the ages of a group of people: [25, 30, 40, 35, 28, 22, 39, 31]. Descriptive statistics for this dataset would include measures like the mean (average) age, the median (middle value), and the standard deviation (a measure of variability).\n",
    "Inferential statistics, on the other hand, involve making predictions, generalizations, or inferences about a population based on a sample from that population. By using probability theory and sampling methods, inferential statistics allow researchers to draw conclusions beyond the immediate data they have.\n",
    "Suppose we want to know the average height of all students in a school, but it's impractical to measure every student. Instead, we take a random sample of 100 students and calculate their average height. Then, we use inferential statistics to estimate the average height of the entire student population based on this sample. We can also determine the margin of error associated with the estimate to understand the uncertainty of the inference.\n",

    "Concept:- \n",
    "Multiprocessing: It involves running multiple processes, where each process has its own memory space and resources. Each process excutes independently and can perform different task simultaneouly\n",
    "multithreading: It involves running multiple threads within a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process. threads work together and can execute multiple tasks concurently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources Allocation:-\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space and resources, which means that the processes do not directly share data. Communication between processes usually involves more overhead, such as inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process, making it easier to share data between threads. Communication between threads can be done through shared variables or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency and Parallelism:-\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiple processes can run in parallel on multiple CPUs or CPU cores, making it suitable for systems with multiple processors. It enables true parallel execution since each process runs independently.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads run concurrently within a single process, but on a single CPU or CPU core. While threads can provide concurrent execution, they may not achieve true parallelism unless running on a multi-core system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead:-\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Starting and managing multiple processes involve higher overhead, such as memory and resource allocation, context switching, and inter-process communication.\n",
    "Multithreading: Creating and managing threads have lower overhead compared to processes since they share the same memory space. Context switching between threads is faster than between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability and Isolation:-\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Since processes have separate memory spaces, if one process crashes, it does not affect other processes. Processes provide better stability and isolation.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space, so if one thread crashes, it can potentially affect other threads within the same process. It requires careful synchronization to avoid issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",

    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system which we often call it as DBMS.\n",

The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.\n",
